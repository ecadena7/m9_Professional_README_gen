## Description

${data.description}

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
- [Contact](#contact)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

${data.installation}

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

${data.usage}

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
    - [GitHub Profile:](https://github.com/${data.githubTwo})

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

${data.license} 

${renderLicenseBadge(data.license)}

${renderLicenseLink(data.license)}

## How to Contribute

${data.contribution}
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
  
${data.test}
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
